# Challenges Faced
The challenges we faced with this project were that we had some trouble pushing and pulling changes between the main branch and our remote branches after a group member's changes were merged into the main branch. Once we figured that out, everything went relatively smoothly. We also had a couple of issues with getting our collaborations page to be properly responsive for tablet screen sizes.
